## Dependencies

This library requires the following Arduino library to be installed on your system:

* [embeddedartistry/arduino-printf](https://github.com/embeddedartistry/arduino-printf)

Some pre-built logging classes will depend on other libraries to be installed, such as:

* [greiman/SdFat](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat) (version 2)

## Logging Basics

This library provides multiple logging levels:

* Critical
* Error
* Warning
* Debug
* Off

This library is designed so that a single static logger instance is used across the application. If you have multiple files, the same logging instance will be used in all files as long as you use the provided logging macros.

Log levels are configurable at compile-time and run-time. 

When a log level is set during compile-time, any levels rated "lower" in priority will be excluded. For example, setting the compile-time log level to "critical" will cause "error", "warning", and "debug" log statements to be removed from the binary.

When a log level is set during run-time, log statements lower in priority will remain in the binary but will be ignored by the logger.

## Using the Library

There are multiple ways this library can be used for logging:

1. [Declaring a local logger instance](#declaring-a-local-logger-instance)
2. [Using a global logger instance](#using-a-global-logger-instance)
3. [Using a global logger instance with macros](#using-a-global-logger-instance-with-macros)

### Declaring a Local Logger Instance

Log classes can be instantiated directly within a Sketch or module:

```
#include <CircularBufferLogger.h>

CircularLogBufferLogger<512> Log;
```

To add data to the log, use the following member functions:

* `debug()`
* `info()`
* `warning()`
* `error()`
* `critical()`

These functions accept `printf`-like format strings. All `printf` format codes are supported:

```
Log.info("Loop iteration %d\n", iterations);
```

If the selected logging implementation requires that the program logic controls when to flush the log buffer to the target output (such as the Circular Log Buffer), use the `flush()` member function:

```
  // This code will flush to serial every 10 loop iterations
  if((iterations % 10) == 0)
  {
    printf("Log buffer contents:\n");
    Log.flush();
  }
```

You can clear all contents from the log buffer using `clear()`. This will empty the buffer, but will not flush the contents to the output.

If you want to print to the log without adding any logging formatting, such as a level tag, you can use the `print()` member function.

### Using a Global Logger Instance

You can also create a global logging instance. This approach is useful if you have multiple modules and want to use the same instance across modules.

First, you will need to [create a header which selects or defines a logging strategy](#selecting-a-logging-strategy). This header must be included in your application.

For this approach, you can use whatever alias name you want. You do not need to stick to `PlatformLogger` since the macros are not being used. For example, you could call the alias `Log`:

```
using Log = PlatformLogger_t<CircularLogBufferLogger<1024>>;
```

The wrapper class, `PlatformLogger_t`, enforces a single logger instance for a given class. To interact with the logger instance, you invoke the static member methods:

```
PlatformLogger::debug("This line is added to the log buffer from setup\n");
```

All logging interfaces are supported, as well as the `flush()`, `clear()`, `level(log_level_e)`, and `echo(bool)` functions.

For a full list of supported methods and their prototypes, [see the class definition](https://github.com/embeddedartistry/arduino-logger/blob/9484ffcfa8fbd77c3e45c4c35ba17c10b220b7ca/src/ArduinoLogger.h#L393).

If you need to invoke a method which isn't supported in the global interface, you can access the underlying instance directly using the `inst()` function. Any member function of the underlying logging class can then be invoked on the `inst()`.

```
PlatformLogger::inst().myCustomFunction();
```

### Using a Global Logger Instance with Macros

If you do not want to declare a local instance or a global class directly, you can instead use logging macros which reference a standard definition for a global logger. At this time, only these interfaces support removal of unwanted log statements at compile-time.

First, you will need to [create a header which selects or defines a logging strategy](#selecting-a-logging-strategy). This header must be included in your application.

To interact with the logger, use the following macros:

* `logdebug()`
* `loginfo()`
* `logwarning()`
* `logerror()`
* `logcritical()`

These macros accept `printf`-like format strings. All `printf` format codes are supported:

```
loginfo("Loop iteration %d\n", iterations);
```

If the selected logging implementation requires that the program logic controls when to flush the log buffer to the target output (such as the Circular Log Buffer), use the `logflush()` macro:

```
  // This code will flush to serial every 10 loop iterations
  if((iterations % 10) == 0)
  {
    printf("Log buffer contents:\n");
    logflush();
  }
```

You can clear all contents from the log buffer using `logclear()`. This will empty the buffer, but will not flush the contents to the output.

### Logging from an Interrupt Context

If you are logging from an interrupt context, you do not want `flush()` to be called if the buffer is full. Echoing the log call via `printf` must also be disabled. 

You can achieve this behavior with two strategies:

1. Disabling auto-flushing by:
  1. Setting the appropriate defaults for the `LOG_AUTOFLUSH_DEFAULT` and `LOG_ECHO_EN_DEFAULT` definitions
  2. Calling the `auto_flush()` member function with `false` and calling the `echo()` member function with `false`.
2. Calling the `log_interrupt()` member function, which will temporarily disable these two settings, add the statement to the log buffer, and re-enable the previous settings. Helper functions for each level are also provided: `log_warning_interrupt`, `log_debug_interrupt`, etc.

When auto-flushing is disabled, the user becomes fully responsible for calling `flush()`. as part of the program logic.

When calling `log_interrupt()` with flushing enabled, the buffer will not be auto-flushed until the next `log()` call. Users can still manually flush with the `flush()` API.

You can determine whether an overrun of the buffer contents has occurred by calling `has_overrun()`. The value of this flag is reset after calling `flush()` and `clear()`.

### Selecting a Logging Strategy

#### Local Instances

If you are going to directly declare a non-global logging interface, simply include the header for the desired log strategy and declare an object:

```
#include <CircularBufferLogger.h>

CircularLogBufferLogger<512> Log;
```

#### Global Instances

If you want to use a global instance, you need to wrap the desired strategy with the `PlatformLogger_t` decorator class. The easiest way to do this is by creating a header such as `platform_logger.h`. If you want to use the provided log macros, you must stick to the `PlatformLogger` alias. If you are using the global class interface directly, you can name the alias whatever you want.

In your project, you will need to create a `platform_logger.h` file (or pick another name of your choosing). Within the file, you need two items:

1. An `#include` directive which selects the proper header
2. A `using` statement which defines `PlatformLogger` appropriately for your class
    * A `PlatformLogger_t` templated wrapper type is used to ensure a single static logging instance is provided
    * All logging macros depend on the `using` statement being constructed properly

Here is an example definition of the `platform_logger.h` file. This file uses the `AVRCircularBufferLogger` class, which takes a template parameter specifying a buffer size of 1024 B.

```
#ifndef PLATFORM_LOGGER_HPP_
#define PLATFORM_LOGGER_HPP_

#include <AVRCircularBufferLogger.h>

using PlatformLogger =
    PlatformLogger_t<AVRCircularLogBufferLogger<1024>>;

#endif
```

## Compile-Time Configuration

### Maximum Log Level

By default, all log statements are compiled into a binary. To change the compile-time log level and filter out unwanted messages during compilation, you need to set the `LOG_LEVEL` macro to the desired setting:

```
/// Logging is disabled
#define LOG_LEVEL_OFF 0
/// Indicates the system is unusable, or an error that is unrecoverable
#define LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL 1
/// Indicates an error condition
#define LOG_LEVEL_ERROR 2
/// Indicates a warning condition
#define LOG_LEVEL_WARNING 3
/// Informational messages
#define LOG_LEVEL_INFO 4
/// Debug-level messages
#define LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG 5
```

One approach is to define the `LOG_LEVEL` macro in your build system. 

For example, this will set the compile-time log level to "warning", removing "info" and "debug" messages from the build.

```
-DLOG_LEVEL=3
```

You can also define the `LOG_LEVEL` macro in your `platform_logger.h` file, before including the necessary logging class header:

```
// This will change the compile-time log level to compile-out logdebug messages
#define LOG_LEVEL LOG_LEVEL_INFO
#include <CircularBufferLogger.h>
```

**Currently, compile-time filtering is only supported if you use the global logger instance with the provided library macros.**

### Auto-Flush Behavior

By default, the logging library will automatically flush the contents of the log buffer whenever the contents of the buffer are full. 

You can change the default setting at compile-time using the `LOG_AUTOFLUSH_DEFAULT` definition.

```
-DLOG_AUTOFLUSH_DEFAULT=false
```

You can also define the desired value in `platform_logger.h` before including the necessary logging strategy header.

```
#define LOG_AUTOFLUSH_DEFAULT false
#include <CircularBufferLogger.h>
```

The method used to flush the data depends on the selected logging strategy.

### Log Name Strings

You can re-define the `LOG_LEVEL_NAMES` and `LOG_LEVEL_SHORT_NAMES` macros to provide your own string name definitions for each logging level.

These settings can be changed in the build system, but it is easiest to define them in `platform_logger.h` before including the necessary strategy library header.

### Echo to Serial

By default, the logging library does not echo logging calls to the serial console. You can change the default setting at compile-time using the `LOG_ECHO_EN_DEFAULT` definition.

The logging library will print the output using the `printf` function. To change that output, see the instructions in the [embeddedartistry/arduino-printf](https://github.com/embeddedartistry/arduino-printf) library.

The setting can be changed in your build system or by defining the desired value in `platform_logger.h` before including the necessary logging library header.

```
-DLOG_ECHO_EN_DEFAULT=true
```

```
#define LOG_ECHO_EN_DEFAULT true
#include <CircularBufferLogger.h>
```

### Disable All Logging Calls

You can remove all logging calls from the binary at compile-time by defining `LOG_EN_DEFAULT` to `false`. 

The setting can be changed in your build system or by defining the desired value in `platform_logger.h` before including the necessary strategy library header.

```
-DLOG_EN_DEFAULT=false
```

```
#define LOG_EN_DEFAULT false
#include <CircularBufferLogger.h>
```

Currently, compile-time filtering is only supported if you use the global logger instance with the provided library macros.

## Run-Time Configuration

You can control the run-time logging level using the `loglevel()` macro. This will tell the logging library to filter out levels below the specified priority level.

```
loglevel(log_level_e::info)
```

You can control the echo-to-console behavior during runtime with the `logecho()` macro. This will tell the logging library to enable/disable printing logging calls via `printf()`.

```
logecho(true); // enables echoing via printf()
```

  - Demonstrates the use of a TeensyRobustModuleLogger on a Teensy board using SDIO in FIFO Mode. This logger can use the SD card, the EEPROM, or the circular buffer in RAM. This logger will detect the reboot reason and log that to the file when `begin()` is called. With the SD card, every time the board resets, a new log file will be created.

The log files will increment in count until they reach 254, then they reset back to 1.
* [Circular Log Buffer: Global Instance Interface](examples/CircularLogBuffer_GlobalInst)
  - Same behavior as the Circular Log Buffer example
  - A global logger instance is used, but the macros are not
  - Log statements are called using the static member functions of the global instance wrapper class
  - These calls are forwarded to the chosen log buffer strategy
  - The example still uses `platform_logger.h`, but this header is not required for this configuration. You can locally create your own alias.
* [Circular Log Buffer: Local Instance Interface](examples/CircularLogBuffer_LocalInst)
  - Same behavior as the Circular Log Buffer example
  - A local logger instance is declared. Multiple loggers can be instantiated if desired.
  - Log statements are called directly on the local object

## Creating a Custom Logging Strategy

You can define a custom logging strategy by creating a class derived from `LoggerBase`. You can use the existing log strategies as an example template.

```
template<size_t TBufferSize = (1 * 1024)>
class CircularLogBufferLogger final : public LoggerBase
```

The `LoggerBase` interface requires that you supply the following function in your custom implementation:

* `log_putc()`
  - This function is used to add characters to the underlying log buffer or log destination (e.g. over `Serial`)
* Constructor (needs to call the `LoggerBase` constructor): `CircularLogBufferLogger() : LoggerBase() {}`
* Destructor (can be default)

These functions are used to control optional behaviors of the class. If you do not override them, a default implementation will be supplied.

* `size()`
  - Returns the current size of the log storage, if relevant
  - If not needed, make size() return -1
* `capacity()`
  - Returns the total capacity of the log storage, if relevant
  - If not needed, make size() return -1;
* `internal_size()`
  - Returns the current size of the internal log buffer, if different from the size of the log storage itself (e.g., `size()` returns an SD card file size, while `internal_size()` returns the current size of the internal RAM circular buffer)
  - This function is used to control auto-flushing behavior. Flushing occurs when `internal_size()` == `internal_capacity()`.
  - If not needed, this defaults to `size()`
* `internal_capacity()`
  - Returns the total capacity of the internal log buffer, if different from the size of the log storage itself (e.g., `capacity()` returns space available on the SD card, while `internal_capacity()` returns the capacity of the internal RAM circular buffer)
  - This function is used to control auto-flushing behavior. Flushing occurs when `internal_size()` == `internal_capacity()`.
  - If not needed, this defaults to `capacity()`
* `flush()`
  - If output is buffered and will be sent to an output source at a later time, place the actual log writing/sending logic in `flush()`
* `clear()`
  - Will remove output from the internal buffer without flushing it to the destination
* `log_customprefix()`
  - If you want to add a custom prefix to all log statements, such as a timestamp, override this function

## Tests

Some classes have the ability to be used on a host machine outside of the Arduino SDK.

To run the tests, you will need:
